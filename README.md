# Pomodogo
Pomodogo is a SPA created using Reactjs. 
The basic design for the website is modelled from pomofocus.io, but I will be looking to customize it based on my own theme in the near future.

The purpose of this project is to practice my web development skills and take my first foot into the world of web development.

If you come across this project and have some constructive feedback to provide, I'll be happy to learn from you.

Have a nice day and let's all enjoy coding! :)
